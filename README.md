## About The Project

<p>This component has some interesting CSS challenges in the design. If you're looking to test your CSS skills, this will be a great project for you!
The main challenge is to build out this data storage component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
<br><br>Your users should be able to:
<br>1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size</p>
<br>
<br> <p>I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.</p>




## Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

This project helped me to practice some grid as it's a little difficult for me to make the grid responsive. My goal is to make grid change from 1 row to 2 rows without using media query however I lack enough experience in this. I decided to finish this project as it is and deepen my knowledge of the grid in another project that I plan to make, specifically - a photography portfolio website.
